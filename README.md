# python-challenge

This project is for UPenn Data Science Bootcamp Module 3 Challenge. 

In the PyBank folder, you will find the python script main.py. The script will open a csv file containg Porfit/Loss across months. The script will find the total number of months, net profit/loss, average change between the months, the month with the greatest increase, and the month with the greatest decrease.
In the PyPoll folder, the python script main.py will open a csv file with the voter ID numbers, counties, and who the vote was placed for. The script will find the list of candidates, the total count of votes the candidates recieved, the percentage of votes the candidates recieved, and who won the election. 
Each python script will create a text file in each respective analysis folder showing the results they have found.
